# What is this?
This repository contains my personal Git cheatsheet â€” a curated reference of high-utility Git commands, techniques, and workflows used in real-world backend development, DevOps, and production environments.

---

# Why is this? 
Whenever I forget any porcelain/plumbing command while interacting with git CLI, I usually have 2-3 go-to quick references sources which aid me in speedy memory recall which are - 
- [Git Official Documentation](https://git-scm.com/docs)
- [Oh Shit, Git!?!.com](https://ohshitgit.com)
- [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com) (PS - I mostly use [Laravel's GPT Model](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-XTOuIQ6Tz-laravel-gpt))

# Topics I am Aiming to Cover : 

- Daily Git Workflow (status, add, commit, push)
- Branching & Checkout Patterns
- Rebasing vs Merging (with when to use each)
- Undoing Mistakes (reset, revert, reflog)
- Squash, Stash, Cherry-pick
- Remote Repo Management (origin, upstream, remotes)
- SSH & Token Authentication (with `pbcopy` for macOS)
- GitHub Workflow Snippets
- Cleanups & Force Pushes (when you must, and how to be safe)

---

# Developer Environment

- Git CLI (minimal aliases)
- GitHub + SSH authentication
- macOS/Linux (with clipboard commands like `pbcopy`)
- Editor: VS Code (GitLens for advanced visuals)
- Optional: GitHub Actions or Jenkins CI integrations
